The multiplayer chess game workflow:
	- The server waits for connections.
	- The first player connects to the server, waiting for the second player to connect
	- The second players connects to the server
	- The server starts a new game between the two players with a specific gameID (so that subsequent players' games do not clash)
	- The server assigns Black and White randomly to the players

How the game goes:
	- The player cannot move the pieces from the other player
	- When one player is to move, the other player cannot send anything to the server. He has to wait the opponent to move before
	  he makes a move
	- The message sent between players and the server is only the byte-encoded PGN of the move

In details:
	- When a player presses a button, he sends a request to the server to start the game
	- However, the game cannot be started yet, because the other player has not joined. A new game ID is created
	- The first player can press the button and send the request multiple times, but the request is only registered once
	- Once the second player joins, the game can start
	- The game ID is different among different game types
